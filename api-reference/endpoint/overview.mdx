### Introduction

To 

For example: to create a new invoice, send a POST request to the **/invoices** endpoint with a request body of the invoice object. 

<Note>The API accepts </Note>


### Schema
The API does not **currently** support schemas for the resources. So indexes and constraints are not yet possible. 

As long as the request body contains a valid JSON object, it will be accepted.

<Note>All objects must include a property with name **id** that is the unique identifier.</Note>


### Relationships
The API does not **currently** support any type of relationship between resources. Therefore, the best alterative strategy is to embed the related resources inside the top level resource. 

For example, you can embed a customer object or invoice lines in the invoice object as shown below:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "invoiceNumber": "12345",
    "amount": 100.00,
    "customer": {
        "id": "1",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
    },
    "invoiceLines": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "description": "Product 1",
            "quantity": 1,
            "unitPrice": 100.00
        }
    ]
}
```
