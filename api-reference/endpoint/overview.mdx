### Introduction


<Tip>Are you missing a feature? Please use our [Feature Board](https://insigh.to/b/instant-rest-api) to add a suggestion or upvote existing features. Sign up to the [waitlist](/api-reference/auth/overview) to get notified of future updates and releases.</Tip>

### Good to know
- BaseURL of the API is https://instantrestapi.com/api/
- The resource name can be anything that is accepted in a URL path (such as `invoices` or `customers`), except restricted endpoints `api/temporary-key` and `api/waitlist`. 
- All resources created are scoped to an API key and can only be accessed using that specific key. 

### Creating a resource
Create a resource simply by POSTing a JSON object to the API URL followed by the name of your resource.
For example: to create a new invoice, send a POST request to the `api/invoices` endpoint with a request body of the invoice object. 
The following requirements must be met:
- Header `Content-Type` must be `application/json`
- Request body must not be empty
- Body must be a valid JSON 
- Body must contain `id` field
- Body must be less than 1mb

<Note>POST & PUT are functionally the same, both will "upsert" the object for the specifid id.</Note>

### Filtering & Searching
The API does not **currently** support filtering or searching of resources.  

### Schema
As long as the request body contains a valid JSON object, it will be accepted.

<Note>All objects must include a property with name `id` that is the unique identifier.</Note>

The API does not **currently** support indexes or constraints. 

### Relationships
The API does not **currently** support any type of relationship between resources. 
Instead, you may choose one of the following 2 options.

**1. Embedding related resources**

The easiest strategy is to embed the related resources inside the top level resource. For example, you can embed a customer object or invoice lines in the invoice object as shown below:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "invoiceNumber": "12345",
    "amount": 100.00,
    "customer": {
        "id": "1",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
    },
    "invoiceLines": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "description": "Product 1",
            "quantity": 1,
            "unitPrice": 100.00
        }
    ]
}
```
Any time a customer or invoiceLine is updated, you must also update the whole invoice object to reflect the changes. 

**2. Embedding ids**

Alternatively, you can embed references to other resources by `id` if you keep track of relationsship updates client side. 

For example, consider the below:

<CodeGroup>

```json api/invoices/1
{
    "id": "1",
    "invoiceNumber": "12345",
    "amount": 100.00,
    "customerId": 1,
    "invoiceLineIds": [1]
}
```

```json api/customers/1
{
    "id": "1",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
}
```

```json api/invoicelines/1
{
    "id": "1",
    "description": "Product 1",
    "quantity": 1,
    "unitPrice": 100.00
}
```

</CodeGroup>

So if you request a `DELETE` on `api/invoicelines/1`, you must also do a `PUT` on `api/invoices/1` and remove the invoiceline from `invoiceLineIds` array.
